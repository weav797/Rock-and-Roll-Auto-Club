# Rock-and-Roll-Auto-Club

In this file, you will see a group project I got to partake in during my C# web application course.
This program stores information in an imaginary Auto club called the Rock and Roll auto club. 
Users were designed to be seenonly by employees of this club and possibly some upper managament. 
No customers are allowed to see it.
My contribution was to help with the potential design and any debugging needed should this program not work correctly.
My partner, Caitlyn Nelson, did most of the heavy lifting by creating most of the logic for the computer. 
This project was created in Visual Studio using C# and the .NET framework and the database file was imported from Access.
