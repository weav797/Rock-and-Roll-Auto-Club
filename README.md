# Rock-and-Roll-Auto-Club

In this file, you will see a project I took part in with a small team to help an auto club organize its data.
This program stores information for an Auto club called the Rock and Roll Auto Club. 
Users were designed to be seen only by employees of this club and possibly some upper management. 
The users that can see it have two main tables: 
One for the auto club member's information,
and the other one for storing any information on any car they are restoring.
Users can add new users and vehicles.
There is also a feature to search for any user by a unique ID, and any vehicle by a unique VIN number.
No customers or any other potential users are allowed to see it.
My partner Caitlyn Nelson and I did the heavy lifting by creating most of the logic for the program. 
My other contribution was to help with the potential design and any debugging needed should this program not work correctly.
This project was created in Visual Studio using C# and the .NET framework and the database file was imported from Access.
